Instead, it appears to be a collection of Jesus' sayings and quotations.\n", "The case for Q's existence follows from the argument that neither Matthew nor Luke is directly dependent on the other in the double tradition (defined by New Testament scholars as material that Matthew and Luke share that does not appear in Mark). However, the verbal agreement between Matthew and Luke is so close in some parts of the double tradition that the most reasonable explanation for this agreement is common dependence on a written source or sources. Even if Matthew and Luke are independent (see ", "), the Q hypothesis states that they used a common document. Arguments for Q being a written document include:\n", "The fact that no Q manuscripts exist today does not necessarily argue against its existence. Many early Christian texts no longer exist, and are only known of through citation or mention of them in surviving texts. Once Q's text was incorporated into the body of Matthew and Luke, it may have been no longer necessary to preserve it, just as interest in copying Mark seems to have waned substantially once it was incorporated into Matthew.", " The editorial board of the International Q Project writes: \"During the second century, when the canonizing process was taking place, scribes did not make new copies of Q, since the canonizing process involved choosing what should and what should not be used in the church service.

The new Spanish version has already been approved, with \"por muchos\" (for many) replacing the previous \"por todos los hombres\" (for all men),", " and as early as Pentecost 2009 the change was effected in Hungary from \"mindenkiért\" (for all) to \"sokakért\" (for many);", " but reluctance in some quarters to abandon the use of \"for all\" to represent ", " has caused delay in relation to German and Italian.\n", "In view of the resistance of some ", "-speaking ", ", ", " wrote a personal letter on 14 April 2012 to the ", " conference, which had accepted the change. In it he stressed the importance of using the literal translation.", "\n", "The Italian bishops conference also voted against translating ", " literally as \"per molti\" (for many), and in favour of keeping \"per tutti\" (for all).", " In 2012, Biblicist Francesco Pieri proposed using the phrase \"per una moltitudine\" (for a multitude) as a way of being faithful to the Latin original.", "\n", "In its initial translation of the ", ", the ", " rendered the phrase \"qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum\" as \"which will be shed for you and for all men, so that sins may be forgiven\". (The word \"men\" was later omitted because of complaints that it could be understood as referring only to males.) This version was approved by the ", " of English-speaking countries in 1973 and confirmed by the ", ". It has now been replaced by a more accurate translation.\n", "The 1973 translation was confessedly a non-literal translation, and objections were raised against it not only for this reason but also on the grounds that it could be taken to mean that all are in fact saved, regardless of their relationship to Christ and his Church. Some even claimed that use of the \"for all\" translation made the consecration invalid.", "\n", "As mentioned in the introduction, Biblicist Albert Vanhoye stated that \"pollon\" does not exclude the meaning \"all\" and consequently the English word \"many\" is not an accurate translation as it excludes \"all\".\n", "In defence of the 1973 translation, it was said that the literal translation, \"for many\", could nowadays be taken to mean \"not for all\", contradicting the declaration in ", " that Christ died for all, though not all choose to avail of the redemption won for them by the shedding of Christ's blood.", "\n", "The Dutch bishops chose to translate ", " as \"voor de velen\" (for the many).", " The German Bishops Conference also initially decided to translate ", " as \"für die Vielen\" (for the many), which was to be explained in catechesis as meaning \"for all\"; however, under the influence of a movement that began in Italy and spread to other countries, they then decided in 1968 to adopt instead \"für alle\" (for all).", " The French conference used \"pour la multitude\" (for the multitude), but the Italian Bishops Conference has rejected this expression for use in the Mass in Italian.", "\n", "\"For many\", rather than \"for all\" or \"for the many\", is now the official translation in English. The Holy See is insisting on the same for the German translation, with ", " pointing out that \"neither Matthew nor Mark uses the definite article, so it is not 'for the many', but 'for many'\".", "\n", "In fact, the Latin liturgical phrase ", " is drawn from ", ", which in the original Greek reads περὶ πολλῶν (", "), the form used in the Byzantine Greek liturgy, and from ", ", which in the original Greek reads ὑπὲρ πολλῶν (", "). Unlike Latin, Greek has the definite article, which appears in neither passage. \"For many\", not \"for the many\", is also how all English translations of the Bible translate these phrases. In the view of Manfred Hauke, use in the liturgy of \"for the many\" would be \"a shabby compromise\".", "\n", "Hebrew רבים (rabbim), translated in Greek as πολλῶν (pollon), \"means 'a great number' without any specification as to whether this refers to a totality\".", " This also is without the article: רבים (rabbim), not הרבים (harabbim).\n", "In the ", " ", " of 31 May 1653 ", " declared that it is orthodox Catholic teaching to say that Christ shed his blood for all human beings without exception.", "  Indeed, the traditional blessing of a Paten found in the ", " includes the phrase, \"Jesus Christ Thy Son, Who for our salvation, and of everyone, (pro nostra omniumque salute) chose to immolate Himself to Thee, God the Father, on the gallows of the Cross.\"", "\n", "It is also orthodox Catholic teaching that not all will necessarily avail of the redemption obtained by the shedding of Christ's blood. While Christ's ", " makes salvation available to all, it does not follow that all men are actually saved. This seems never to have been authoritatively defined, since it has remained uncontroversial.\n", "The ", ", also known as the Catechism of the Council of Trent, stated: \"If we look to its value, we must confess that the Redeemer shed his blood for the salvation of all; but if we look to the fruit which mankind have received from it, we shall easily find that it pertains not unto all, but to many of the human race.\"", "\n", "It would be heretical to interpret \"for many\" in the words of consecration of the wine as indicating that there were some for whom the shedding of Christ's blood was in itself incapable of redeeming (its value). So the Roman Catechism interpreted \"for many\" in the context of the consecration form as referring to the effect actually accepted by individuals (its fruits). It declared: \"When therefore (our Lord) said: 'For you', he meant either those who were present, or those chosen from among the Jewish people, such as were, with the exception of Judas, the disciples with whom he was speaking. When he added, 'And for many', he wished to be understood to mean the remainder of the elect from among the Jews or Gentiles.\"\n", "In this, the Roman Catechism differed somewhat from the ", " of Saint ", ".  This interpreted \"for you\" as a reference either to the elect among the Jews, who witnessed the blood shed in the Old Testament sacrifices, or to the priest and the faithful partaking of Mass; and it took \"for many\" to refer either to the elect among the Gentiles, or to those for whom Mass is offered.", "\n", "The Catechism went on to say with regard to the words used in the Roman Canon: \"With reason, therefore, were the words 'for all' not used, as in this place the fruits of the Passion are alone spoken of, and to the elect only did His Passion bring the fruit of salvation. And this is the purport of the Apostle when he says: 'Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many'; and also of the words of our Lord in John: 'I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me, because they are thine'.\"\n", "It would also be heretical to interpret \"for all\" in the words of consecration of the wine as indicating that, without any exception, everybody must in concrete fact receive the benefit won by the shedding of Christ's blood. So the ", " has interpreted \"for all\" in the 1973 English translation of the consecration form as referring to the value of the shedding of Christ's blood and to his intention. On 25 January 1974, the ", " declared that there was no doubt whatsoever regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using \"for all\" as a translation of \"pro multis\", since \"for all\" corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ's intention expressed in the words of the consecration, and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all (cf.
