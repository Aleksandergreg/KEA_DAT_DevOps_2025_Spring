# Let's brainstorm: Simple deployment strategies

How would you go about deploying new versions of the application?

I am not looking for the optimal solution since your deployment strategy is bound to change throughout the course.

Our goal with the brainstorming session is to end with a simple solution that you could implement today.

*Suggestions?*

---

# Ways to deploy a new version of an application

* File transfer via SCP/FTP -> manual restart

* SSH -> git pull -> manual restart

* Cron job on the server that keeps syncing with a git repo

* Using build systems / CI/CD

*If you had to create two categories for types of deployment, which of these would be in the first?*

# Push vs. Pull-based Deployment

[![Push vs. Pull-based deployment](http://img.youtube.com/vi/f5EpcWp0THw/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f5EpcWp0THw?list=PLy7NrYWoggjxKDRWLqkd4Kbt84XEerHhB&t=418)

For now pull-based deployment will do, but we are aiming for push-based deployment.

# Example: Cron job for continuous deployment


```cron
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && git pull && <command to rerun application>
```

*There's something less optimal about the above approach. Can you spot it?*

# Crontab: optimized version


The previous example pulls the repository and restarts the repository every time. Instead, only do it when there is a new commit.

```cron
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && git fetch && [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$(git rev-parse @{u})" ] && git pull && <command to stop the application> && <command to run the application>
```

**Tip**: The cron job is getting complicated. Create a shell script that your cron job can run.

**Note**: These cronjob slides are not an endorsement for picking this solution. They serve to introduce you to the concept.

# Remember to continuously improve your deployment strategy

It's great if you can get something working quickly.

You will get many chances to iterate on your deployment strategy.

But be willing to discard it as something better presents itself.

This course is about letting go of legacy, even the parts you create.

# Next Week - Trial run

Make sure that you have deployed and made a PR to `repositories.py` with the IP address.

We will make a trial run of the simulation next week so you get 1 week to fix issues. 

The real simulation starts in 2 weeks.
