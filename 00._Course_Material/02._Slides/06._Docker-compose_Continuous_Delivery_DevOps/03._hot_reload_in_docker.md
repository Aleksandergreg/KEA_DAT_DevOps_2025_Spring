# Hot-reload

Java: `jrebel`

Node.js: `nodemon`

Python frameworks usually have hot-reload built-in but nodemon works well to run Python code in Docker in development. 

**Problem**: Docker makes it harder to achieve hot-reload.  

**Goal**: Improve the development experience by automatically reloading the application when the code changes.

# Let's create a simple server in Node.js

1. Let's create a folder called `04._Docker_Node_Project`.

2. Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.

3. Install Express (a server framework) with `npm install express`.

4. Create an `app.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 8080');
});
```

# Nodemon with Docker example

Create a `Dockerfile.dev` file:

```Dockerfile
FROM node

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Install nodemon globally
RUN npm install -g nodemon

COPY . .

CMD npm config set prefer-offline true && nodemon app.js
```

# Docker-compose.dev.yml

Create a docker-compose file outside of `node_project`. This allows for a nicer separation from the server if we create more services later on. 

The docker-compose file allows us to define volumes which is necessary for caching the `node_modules` folder:

```Dockerfile
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./node_project
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./node_project:/usr/src/app
      - backend_node_modules:/usr/src/app/node_modules

volumes:
  backend_node_modules:
```

---

# Running the setup

Where the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file is located:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Try to make a change in `app.js` and see the magic happen.

# WhoKnows Variations - Continuous Delivery

Let's look at the different guides and run the application locally.

https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/continuous_delivery/

To run the application locally, cd to `src` where the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file is and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
