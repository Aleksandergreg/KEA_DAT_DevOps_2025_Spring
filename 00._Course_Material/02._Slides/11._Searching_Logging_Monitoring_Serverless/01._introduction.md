# Remember to be DevOps

I can task you to do technical assignments but you have to solve the DevOps task yourself.

There is guaranteed to be friction in your group. 

*How do identify problems?*

*How do you solve them?*

*How do you achieve psychological safety in your group so that members can speak out about the issues?*

If I ask you in the Exam how the group work was and you say "perfect" and nothing more I will be sceptical.

Take this reflection-solving mentality with you when you write your thesis.
