# Install and log in to `az`

`az` is the Azure CLI. By logging in locally Terraform can get access to our cloud.

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-build

```bash
$ az login
```

Verify the login:

```bash
$ az account show
```

---

# Clarification: Terraform under the hood

Though possible to provision everything through `az`, this is not how Terraform does it.

Terraform uses `az` to generate a user token for authorization.

This token is used to validate against what they call [Azure REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

---

# Install Terraform

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform

Success criterion: You can run the following and see the version number:

```bash
$ terraform --version
```

---

# Suggestions for later 1: Install auto-completion for Terraform

Install terraform auto-complete (tab completion) for your terminal:

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli#enable-tab-completion

---

# Suggestions for later 2: Alias `terraform` as `tf`

Aliasing the `terraform` command so that you can invoke it by simply typing `tf` is pretty standard practice for Terraform users.

***nix**: 

Write `alias tf="terraform"` in the terminal and it will work in the session.

For a more permanent solution add this to your terminal's rc file (such as ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc).

**Windows**: Create a terminal profile if it doesn't exist, in either case open it

```powershell
$ if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force }
notepad.exe $PROFILE
```
You can now manually add this line to it and save:

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name tf -Value terraform
```

# Let's create our first Terraform project

In an empty folder run:

```bash
$ terraform init

It is missing a configuration file. Let's create `main.tf`. Then run init again.

# .tf files and VSCode Extensions

The `.tf` file extension is used for Terraform. In VSCode there are extensions for syntax highlighting and Intellisense. 

The official one by Hashicorp seems to be universally hated. Instead, consider the one that is higher rated.

# Terraform Planning

During the planning, Terraform tries to assess the current state and find out how to get to the desired state. 

It creates a dependency graph of all resources and the order that they must be created in.

*When creating a virtual machine in Azure what ressources need to be created and in what order?*

  <summary>Hint - How many that are needed</summary>
   8 resources have to be created.

# Terraform commands - overview

| Command                | Description                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `terraform init`       | Initializes a Terraform configuration directory. Prepares your directory for other commands, installs necessary providers. |
| `terraform plan`       | Shows a preview of the actions Terraform plans to take based on the configuration files. Useful for reviewing changes before applying them. |
| `terraform apply`      | Applies the changes described by `terraform plan`. Provisions or updates infrastructure according to the Terraform configuration. |
| `terraform destroy`    | Removes all resources defined in the Terraform configuration, tearing down the managed infrastructure. |
| `terraform fmt`        | Automatically formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. |
| `terraform validate`   | Validates the syntax of the Terraform configuration files for correctness. |
| `terraform output`     | Displays the output variables defined in the configuration, useful for extracting important information like IP addresses. |
| `terraform refresh`    | Updates the local state file against real-world resources, realigning the state with the actual state of resources in the cloud. |
| `terraform import`     | Brings real-world infrastructure into Terraform management by adding it to the Terraform state file. |
| `terraform workspace`  | Manages different workspaces, allowing for managing separate states for the same configuration, useful for different environments (e.g., staging, production). |

# Let's add the Azure Provider

1. Get the Azure Provider snippet in the [provider docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs). 

    <img src="./assets_terraform_get_started/azure_provider.png" style="height: 22vh;" alt="azure provider terraform snippet">

2. Paste it in the `main.tf` file. 

3. Run the following to download initialize which downloads the provider locally:

```bash
$ terraform init
```

*What was created?*

---

# Terraform `.gitignore`

The provider is a large file which will cause problems if pushed to git

Add Terraform templates to your `.gitignore`. Find one by searching for Terraform in [gitignore.io](http://www.gitignore.io):

This will also ensure that no Terraform secrets (like the state file) are pushed to git.

---

# [Optional step] Format

Formatting will make your code look nicer: 

```bash
$ terraform fmt
```

# Azure Virtual Machine with hardcoded and visible password

# Terraform Validate + Plan

```bash
$ terraform validate
$ terraform plan
```

*What happens?*

---

# Subscription ID

Seeing how validate succeeds while plan doesn't shows the difference. 

`validate` is to check the syntax and internal consistency. 

`plan` is to check execution logic.

We are missing the subscription ID. Get it by running:

```bash
$ az account show
```

The `id` field is the subscription ID.

In the `main.tf` file, replace the subscription ID to the provider block:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
    subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

**Note**: This is another thing that we do not wish to hardcode and push.

---

# Terraform Apply

Running apply will give you an overview once again. Type `yes` to enact them:

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

Once finished look for this line and the numbers instead of X, Y, Z:

```
Apply complete! Resources: **X** added, **Y** changed, **Z** destroyed.
```

---

# Can we SSH into it?

Go into the Azure portal and check if the VM is running. Copy the `ip_address` and try to SSH into it:

```bash
$ ssh adminuser@<ip_address>
```

Enter the password as defined in the `main.tf` file.

---

# Create a `outputs.tf` file

Wouldn't be neat if we could get some dynamic information after applying? 

We can define that if we create a file named exactly `outputs.tf` in the same directory as the `main.tf` file.

```hcl
output "public_ip_address" {
  value = azurerm_public_ip.terraform_class.ip_address
}

output "ssh_command" {
  value = "ssh ${azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.terraform_class.admin_username}@${azurerm_public_ip.terraform_class.ip_address}"
}
```

Then run apply again:

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

---

# Visualizing the Dependency Graph

Combining Terraform and GraphViz, you can actually visualize the graph on *nix:

```bash
$ terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

Resulting in a graph like this:

<img src="./assets_terraform_get_started/terraform_dependency_graph.png" alt="terraform dependency graph">


---

# Declare variables

To exemplify using variables for both **secrets** and **dynamic values**, create a `variables.tf` file (named exactly that and in the same directory as the `main.tf` file):

```hcl
variable "subscription_id" {
  description = "The azure subscription ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "vm_name" {
  description = "The name of the virtual machine"
  type        = string
  default     = "main-vm"
}

variable "ssh_password" {
  description = "The password for the SSH user"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

The `sensitive = true` value ensure that the password is never printed in the console.

---

# Define variables

Then define them in a `terraform.tfvars` file (fill out the correct subscription ID):

```hcl
subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
vm_name = "main-vm"
ssh_password = "badpassword1!"
```

*What would happen if we don't define `vm_name`?*

---

# Use variables

In `main.tf` replace the hard-coded values with the two variables like this:

```hcl
var.subscription_id
var.vm_name
var.ssh_password
```

*Can you figure out where to replace with variables?*

To summarize, because `*.tfvars` are part of the standard `.gitignore` template for Terraform, defining secrets there ensure that we do not push sensitive data to Terraform while being able to retrieve them in our `.tf` files. It also allows us to define dynamic and reusable values in a single place. We can't use libraries like `.env` since HCL is not an imperative programming language.

# Overview: The Files of Terraform

| File Type              | Description                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `*.tf` / `*.tf.json`   | Infrastructure definitions in HCL or JSON.            |
| `*.tfvars` / `*.tfvars.json` | Variable definitions for configurations.                |
| `.terraform.lock.hcl` | Tracks provider versions and dependencies.            |
| `outputs.tf`           | Defines output values from Terraform.                 |
| State Files (`terraform.tfstate`, `terraform.tfstate.backup`) | Maps configurations to real-world resources.            |

# Replace password authentication with SSH key

If you have a RSA SSH key, then replace the password authentication with the public key.

Find this block:

```hcl
  disable_password_authentication = false             # flip this to true     
  admin_password                  = var.ssh_password  # delete this line
```

And replace it with this:

```hcl
  disable_password_authentication = true
  admin_ssh_key {
    username   = "adminuser"
    public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
  }
```

Now apply and try to ssh into the VM.

If you suceed at this step, delete the `ssh_password` variable. 

---

# Add a remote provisioner

This is not what you should use Terraform for, but it will be useful for your projects.

Inside of the `azurerm_linux_virtual_machin` block, add the following:

```hcl
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = split("\n", templatefile("${path.module}/inline_commands.sh", {}))

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "adminuser"
      private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
      host        = self.public_ip_address
      timeout     = "2m"
    }
  }
```

---

# Create a `inline_commands.sh` file

Make sure that there are no empty lines as they will not be valid shell commands.

The echo commands are because you cannot pass comments to the shell. 

```bash
echo "============================================================================================"
echo "Update packages"
echo "============================================================================================"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
echo "============================================================================================"
echo "Install Docker and give user permission"
echo "============================================================================================"
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

---

# Time to destroy

This will tear down your cloud services provisioned by Terraform:

```bash
$ terraform destroy
```

As mentioned earlier, the smart thing about Terraform is that they take care of the dependency graph 
and will shut down services in the necessary order. 

*Verify in Azure Portal that it is gone.*

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Terraform Workspaces</h1>
</div>

---

# Workspaces

Similar to branches. Each workspace is its own context. 

Type the following to see the possible options:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace
```

*Using the help menu, can you solve the assignment?* 

## Assignment:

1. List workspaces.
2. Create a new workspace called `dev` and one named `prod`.
3. Select the `dev` workspace.
4. Show the current workspace.
5. Select the `prod` workspace.

**Bonus Question**: *What keeps track of what the current workspace is?*

---

# Solution: Working with workspaces

```bash
$ terraform workspace list
$ terraform workspace new dev 
$ terraform workspace new prod
$ terraform workspace select dev
$ terraform workspace show
$ terraform workspace select prod
```

---


# Why workspaces in Terraform?

*Consider why...*

---

# Why workspaces in Terraform?

Each workspace maintains its own state, allowing for isolated management of resources.

Besides having different environments like `dev`/ `test` / `prod`, you can also create sandboxes for each developer.

Or you can use it to create a white label solution for each client.

The state is kept in `terraform.tfstate`file inside of the `terraform.tfstate.d` directory.

In a project with provisioned resources, the state file changes with the workspace.
