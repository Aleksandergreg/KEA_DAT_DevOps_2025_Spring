# The LIKE operator vs. FTS5

Example of a query using the `LIKE` operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE content LIKE '%search%';
```

Create a FTS5 table:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE pages USING fts5(title, content);
```

Example with FTS5 (search, searches, searching, searched and more):

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE pages MATCH 'search';
```

With wildcards (run, ran, rain and so many more):

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE pages MATCH 'r*n';
```

# FTS5

* **Indexing**: While the LIKE operator performs a sequential scan over rows, FTS5 uses tokenization and word positions to create an index for words.

* **Tokenization**: FTS5 breaks down the text into words.

* **Search capabilities**: FTS5 allows for more complex search queries: pattern matching with `%` and wildcards with `*`. Supports proximity matching. 

* **Performance**: FTS5 is faster than the LIKE operator.
