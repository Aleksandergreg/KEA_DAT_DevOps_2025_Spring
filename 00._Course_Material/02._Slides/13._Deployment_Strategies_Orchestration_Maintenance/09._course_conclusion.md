# Debois' definition of DevOps


> *It's taken me 10-plus years to come up with my own one-line definition of DevOps:*

> ***"DevOps is whatever you do to bridge friction created by silos, and all the rest is engineering."***

> *And so, if you're doing technology just for the technology and you're not trying to overcome some friction of the human kind of siloing or group siloing or information siloing or whatever, then you're just doing the engineering part and you're not, in my opinion, doing the DevOps part."*

\- Patrick Debois

# Were you DevOps?

The big exam question: *Were you DevOps?*

While you have to ask yourselves if you were DevOps you should also ask if you did what was best for your team in the context of the course.

DevOps offers a solution to common problems.

# Was I DevOps?

DevOps shouldn't be the end goal. 

It's about continuous improvement. 

I hope you can use this in your general life.
