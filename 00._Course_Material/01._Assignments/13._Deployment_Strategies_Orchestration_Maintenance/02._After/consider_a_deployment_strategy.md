## Agree on a deployment strategy

Discuss with your group the various deployment strategies from the lecture or other sources.

Consider how to improve the current setup to achieve high availability, fault tolerance and scalability.

Feel free to bring this up during your exam presentation and be ready to answer what considerations informed your decision.

**To be clear**: It is not expected that you implement this in your project.
